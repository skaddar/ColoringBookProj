# ColoringBookProj
CS 3300 coloring book app project.

Our project focuses on developing an AI-powered Coloring Book Generator. This application allows users to input an image, and the system will generate a simplified, outline-style version suitable for coloring.

----Problem Statement:----

The main problem we aim to solve is the lack of easy and accessible tools for converting images into high-quality coloring pages. Many existing solutions require manual tracing or expensive software, making it difficult for users without advanced design skills.

------Our Solution:-------

Our tool automates this process, making it accessible to artists, educators, parents, and children who want to create personalized coloring books effortlessly.
